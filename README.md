# UV Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
The UV Sensor project showcases how to interface a UV sensor with an Arduino Mega to measure UV intensity levels. UV sensors are essential for monitoring UV exposure levels, which is crucial for applications involving UV radiation detection and safety.

#### Components Needed
- **Arduino Mega**
- **UV Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the UV Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **UV Sensor OUT Pin (uvSensorPin):** Connected to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **+5V Pin:** Connected to the VCC pin of the UV sensor module.
   - **GND Pin:** Connected to the GND pin of the UV sensor module.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Launch the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

2. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe UV intensity values displayed in the Serial Monitor.
   - Place the UV sensor under different lighting conditions to observe changes in UV intensity readings.

#### Applications
- **UV Index Monitoring:** Measure UV levels for assessing exposure risks.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Monitor UV radiation in natural and artificial environments.
- **Safety Applications:** Implement UV sensors in devices for sun protection and UV-sensitive equipment.

#### Notes
- **Analog Readings:** UV intensity readings are analog values obtained from the sensor.
- **Calibration:** Sensor calibration may be necessary for accurate UV index readings.
- **Serial Output:** Serial communication facilitates real-time monitoring and logging of UV intensity levels.
